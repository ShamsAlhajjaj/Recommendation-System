## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Laravel Recommendation System

A recommendation system built with Laravel that suggests relevant content to users based on their preferences and behavior.

## Features

- User authentication and profile management
- Article browsing and interaction (view, like)
- Personalized content recommendations based on user behavior
- Admin panel for content and user management
- Caching for improved performance

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

The application uses the Repository pattern to abstract the data layer from the business logic:

- **ArticleRepositoryInterface** and **ArticleRepository**: Handle CRUD operations for articles
- **RecommendationRepositoryInterface** and **RecommendationRepository**: Handle recommendation storage and retrieval
- **InteractionRepositoryInterface** and **InteractionRepository**: Handle user interactions with content

Benefits:
- Separation of concerns
- Improved testability
- Consistent data access layer
- Easier to switch data sources if needed

### Service Pattern

The application uses the Service pattern to encapsulate complex business logic:

- **RecommendationService**: Contains the recommendation algorithm and logic

Benefits:
- Keeps controllers thin
- Reusable business logic
- Easier to test complex algorithms

### Observer Pattern

The application uses Laravel's Observer pattern to handle events:

- **InteractionObserver**: Generates recommendations when a user interacts with content
- **ArticleObserver**: Clears caches when articles are created, updated, or deleted

Benefits:
- Decouples event handling from business logic
- Automatically triggers actions based on model events
- Keeps the codebase clean and maintainable

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: Extensive use of Laravel's caching system to store:
  - User recommendations
  - Article lists
  - User interaction history
  
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart cache invalidation using observers to ensure data is always fresh

- **Database Optimization**:
  - Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
  - Eager loading of relationships to prevent N+1 query problems

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
composer install

DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=recommendation_system
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```
